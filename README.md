## Description
The main purpose of this module is to build an entire application using object-oriented programming, or OOP for short. With the introduction of OOP and Test Driven Development (TDD), a terminal game was created with Node.js. We learnt how to seperate data and functionality into different constructor function, discussed inheritance between classes, and went over using mock data to quickly run tests. The project was completed using both ES5 and ES6 syntax.

This application uses Node.,js, the Jest framework to run tests on the code, and Inquirer for command prompts for user input. Game logic was also introduced, as well as code modularization.
